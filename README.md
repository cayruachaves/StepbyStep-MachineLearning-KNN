# Step-by-Step Machine Learning: KNN

Step-by-step guide to implement a simple machine learning model: K-nearest neighbors algorithm.

**Notes:** 
- Jupyter notebook includes explanations of all steps necessary to implement the model from scratch.
- To run `01_KNN_tutorial.ipynb`, you will need the csv file with the dataset used as example. You can download the csv file [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ho01tzvnm0iwynh/LoanStats3a.csv?dl=1). Download it and saved it in the same folder where you have `01_KNN_tutorial.ipynb`
- Also, for aesthetic reasons you might want to download and save in the same folder the three `.png` files above. These do not affect the functioning of the notebook and are only used as tools to aid in cells that explain the the intuition behind machine learning and KNN.

# Step-by-Step Machine Learning: KNN

Step-by-step guide to implement a simple machine learning model: K-nearest neighbors algorithm.

**Notes:** 
- Jupyter notebook includes explanations of all steps necessary to implement the model from scratch.
- If you want to run the notebook, you will need the csv file with the dataset used as example. You can download the csv file [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ho01tzvnm0iwynh/LoanStats3a.csv?dl=1).
